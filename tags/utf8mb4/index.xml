      <description>I was working on emoji support of legacy application written in Python with MySQL as database. And I was unable to save emojis on it, though encoding was perfect i.e. UTF8 (Or I though it was ðŸ˜‚). Turns out I was wrong.
After going through docs of mysql, which were explaining encoding UTF8, I was amused to see that it in fact only supports 3 bytes for a character. And emojis, well they take 4 bytes.</description>
