      <description>Using just sql scripts for managing database schema migrations is alright. But in that case we have to explicitly create a system where we have to keep track of the sequences of the scripts (one of the reasons: foreign key dependencies). While in development environment, if we want to check whether existing function/method code compatible with earlier table schema, we have to manually write some commands in our favorite db client.</description>

      <description>I was working on emoji support of legacy application written in Python with MySQL as database. And I was unable to save emojis on it, though encoding was perfect i.e. UTF8 (Or I though it was ðŸ˜‚). Turns out I was wrong.
After going through docs of mysql, which were explaining encoding UTF8, I was amused to see that it in fact only supports 3 bytes for a character. And emojis, well they take 4 bytes.</description>
